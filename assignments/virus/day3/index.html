        <div class="date">MARCH 23</div>

        <div class="body">CONFINED TO WATCHING
           MUSIC DOCUMENTARIES WITH DAD. ALTHOUGH WE
           HAVE THE PATIO. IT’S WHERE WE GET OUR FRESH
           AIR WHILE LISTENING <br>TO MUSIC (PICTURED). YET,
           KNOWING THAT I CANNOT LEAVE IS CONSTANTLY ON
           MY MIND. STAYING HOME IS DEFINITELY NOT MY
           THING. I’M THE TYPE OF PERSON THAT LOVES TO
           CONSTANTLY BE OUT OF THE HOUSE. THAT IS WHY
           THE IDEA OF SELF QUARANTINE IS CLOSE TO A
           NIGHTMARE FOR ME.<br> TO MAKE IT WORSE, NORTH
           CAROLINA IS THE LAST PLACE I WANT TO BE IN
           GENERAL. GROWING UP <br>IN A SMALL TOWN, WHERE
           NOTHING HAPPENS, EVERYONE WANTS TO BE IN YOUR
           BUSINESS. HERE <br>I HAVE NO PRIVACY, EVEN THOUGH
           EVERYTHING IS MUCH FARTHER APART. FUNNY HOW
           THAT WORKS.
