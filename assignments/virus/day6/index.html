        <div class="date">MARCH 26</div>

        <div class="body">TODAY I WAS THE ONLY ONE
           WHO WANTED TO BE OUTDOORS. I DANCED AND
           RAN AROUND WHILE LISTENING <br>TO MUSIC.
           BITTERSWEET BECAUSE I <br> AM LUCKY TO HAVE
           THAT MUCH ROOM OUTSIDE, BUT IT MAKES ME REALLY
           <br>MISS DANCING WITH MY ROOMMATES <br>IN NYC.
           CONSTRAINED FROM BEING WITH MY ROOMATES
           MAKES ME SUPER SAD. ALTHOUGH, ALL THIS
           WILL HOPEFULLY BE OVER IN A COUPLE MONTHS,
           AND THEN WE WILL ALL DANCE AGAIN.
