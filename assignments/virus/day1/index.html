      <div class="body">TODAY IS MY LAST DAY IN
        NYC. WHERE <br>I CAN STILL FEEL MORE FREE
        (ALONE IN <br>MY APARTMENT) THAN I EVER COULD
        <br>IN NORTH CAROLINA. I’M WRITING THIS ON THE
        PLANE HOME. I LOVE FLYING, BUT KNOWING THAT
        I AM GOING TO BE STUCK <br>IN  MY CHILDHOOD HOME
        AGAIN MAKES <br>ME FEEL CLAUSTROPHOBIC (EVEN
        ON <br>THIS EMPTY PLANE). YET, I KNOW IT
        IS FOR THE BEST. EVERYDAY THOUSANDS MORE
        GET SICK, AND THE CITY’S RESOURCES ARE
        LIMITED. YET, I WILL STILL MISS NY, EVEN
        AS IT IS.
