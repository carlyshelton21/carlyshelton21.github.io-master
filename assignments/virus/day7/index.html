        <div class="date">MARCH 27</div>

        <div class="body">IT WAS FINALLY OKAY FOR ME
          TO DRIVE AROUND SINCE DAD FILLED UP MY CAR.
          <br>I WENT FOR A LONG DRIVE INTO VIRGINIA ALONE
          WITH MY WINDOWS DOWN BLASTING NOISE. I GOT
          AN OLD SENSE OF FREEDOM BUT ALSO CONSTRAINT.
          <br>A RESULT OF NOT BEING ABLE TO STOP AND EXPLORE.
          YET, IT WAS DEFINITELY ENJOYABLE TO SEE MORE
          OF THE WORLD THAN JUST THE SURROUNDINGS OF MY
          CHILDHOOD HOME FOR A COUPLE FREEING HOURS.
