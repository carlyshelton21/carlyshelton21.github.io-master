        <div class="date">MARCH 25</div>

        <div class="body">MY PARENTS AND I HANG OUT ON
           <br>THE PATIO EVERYDAY LISTENING TO MUSIC AS OUR
           ESCAPE.
           DURING, DAD AND I ALWAYS HAVE OUR COFFEE <br>AND
           NICOTINE FIX.
           ALTHOUGH, BEING OUTSIDE ALWAYS
           TEMPTS ME TO GO OUT PAST THE BOUNDARIES OF
           MY PREVIOUS HOME. I CANNOT DO THIS <br>AS A RESULT
           OF MY FATHER BEING UNWILLING TO FILL UP MY GAS
           TANK. WHICH IS UNDERSTANDABLE AS IT IS UNNECESSARY.
