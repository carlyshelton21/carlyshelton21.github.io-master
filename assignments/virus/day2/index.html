        <div class="date">MARCH 22</div>

        <div class="body">YESTERDAY, WHEN I ARRIVED
           IN NORTH CAROLINA THE AIRPORT WAS FULL.
           I FELT SUFFOCATED BY THE LACK OF SERIOUSNESS.
           MY PARENTS PICKED ME UP AND BEGAN <br>TO SMOTHER
           ME WITH QUESTIONS. ON THE WAY HOME WE PICKED
           UP GROCERIES AT <br>THE LOCAL GROCERY STORE. THERE
           WERE MANY PEOPLE THERE TOO. YET THIS TIME THEY
           ALL KNEW ME AND WERE DYING TO <br>INTEGRATE ME. I
           FELT IMPRISONED BY THEIR CONVERSATIONS FROM MY
           RECENT LACK <br>OF INTERACTION. I POLITELY JUST
           ENDED UP WAVING AT THEM WITH MY SWEATY LATEX
           GLOVED HANDS.
