                    <span class="name">"Jorge Manjarrez Moreno</span>
                    was born on October 1st 1939 in the city of Guadalajara, Mexico. He studied Mechanical Engineering at the University of Guadalajara and graduated in 1962. Right after he graduated he had his first job in the state of Nayarit,
                    Mexico at a
                    tobacco factory where he worked for six years. During these years he learned everything about tobacco and its production, from the growing of it to its distribution to cigarette companies. In 1968 he started working at CIGATAM in
                    Guadalajara which means Cigarros la Tabacalera Mexicana. This company belongs to Philip Morris. During the 31 years he worked there as a CEO of the factory he learned more in depth about the production, branding and advertising of
                    Marlboro cigarettes. The factory even became the most successful company in Mexico at a point solving all the problems it ever had about quality, packaging, flavor and even the employees worked very efficiently due to the great
                    work
                    environment and benefits they received from the company. He retired in 1999 after 31 years of serving the company and received many awards for his hard work during these years."

        <h3 class="Mbody2"><br> Q: How does cigarette branding create such a deep rooted identity to the point where it becomes second nature to purchase their brand?<br><br>
            A: The red and white from a Marboro pack is very visually appealing. Nowadays it is a brand everyone knows, such as the McDonald’s logo. It looks very old school and classic. It feels comfortable to the point that one wants to purchase it
            just like purchasing a cup of coffee at starbucks.<br><br><br><br>
            Q: How does branding and graphic design influence this second nature?<br><br>
            A: When one wakes up and craves the flavor of a cigarette in the morning or when one is having a drink and wants a cigarette with it. Usually nicotine is what makes one so hooked to it.

        <h1>Q:</h1>
        <h2>What do you know about Marlboro’s branding choices? Specifically, if there was a specific identity for the cigarettes themselves?</h2>
        <br><br>
        <h1>A:</h1>
        <p>After Coca Cola, Marlboro became the second most expensive brand in the world back in the day. The identity of the cigarettes relates a lot to the Marlboro man who is not as present in the cigarettes as he used to be before. The
            Marlboro man was this middle aged, mature looking cowboy.
            He was an attractive man which gave Marlboro cigarettes that classy look and identity. </p>
        <br><br><br><br><br><br>
        <h1>Q:</h1>
        <h2>I know Marlboro started advertising their cigarettes towards women and then changed to a more masculine branding approach in the 1950’s, when you worked there did you sense there was a strong point in the branding department to
            advertise to men?</h2>
        <br><br>
        <h1>A:</h1>
        <p>So before the 50’s the Marlboro man was intended to make woman attracted to him and that is why cigarette branding was more towards women but it turned out that men identified with the man more or wanted to be like him to eventually it
            ended up targeting more men than women. I started working at the factory as a director in 1968 and the publicity did not really change anymore. </p>
        <br><br><br><br><br><br>
        <h1>Q:</h1>
        <h2>I know that the branding at Marlboro has not changed much since the 1950’s, but when you worked there, were there any changes to the branding and advertising of the brand?</h2>
        <br><br>
        <h1>A:</h1>
        <p>The changes began because of health issues. Cigarettes did not have filters before and we had to start adding filters because of health laws the government was passing. The impact of the cigarettes also changed like how harsh they
            would be and the different cigarettes started being made such as light or menthols etc. </p>
        <br><br><br><br><br><br>
        <h1>Q:</h1>
        <h2>Do you believe that cigarette branding is more effective than the actual blend of the tobacco itself?</h2>
        <br><br>
        <h1>A:</h1>
        <p>Absolutely, there have been cigarettes made with amazing tobacco blends but the advertising or branding was not great so they never became popular. The branding is a key factor for success in any product not only in cigarettes.</p>
