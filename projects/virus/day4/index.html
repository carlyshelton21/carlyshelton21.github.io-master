        <div class="body">LISTENING TO ANGRY MUSIC REALLY
           LOUD ON MY DAD’S JBL SPEAKERS IS WHAT’S
            KEEPING ME SANE. ONE OF THE FEW ASPECTS I
             MISSED FROM NORTH CAROLINA. ANOTHER WAS MAKING
             ART FOR MYSELF, BUT THAT HAS BECOME DIFFICULT
              SINCE MY MOTHER HAS INCREASINGLY BECOME MORE
               OF A HOARDER. WISH ME LUCK ON CLEARING OUT
                AN AREA IN THE HOUSE TO WORK.
